      Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables. JavaScript
      variables have 3 types of scope: Block scope Function scope Global scope
      1.ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
      These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables declared
      inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block: 2.Variables
      declared within a JavaScript function, are LOCAL to the function:
      3.JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.
      Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from
      outside the function. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite
      similar when declared inside a function. They all have Function Scope: 4.A
      variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL. 5.Variables declared
      Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be
      accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with
      var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. 6.If
      you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will
      automatically become a GLOBAL variable. 7.All modern browsers support
      running JavaScript in "Strict Mode".

      <b>Hoisting</b><b>Declare Your Variables At the Top !</b>
      Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of
      JavaScript. If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may
      contain bugs (errors).
    </p>
    <p>
      "use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict
      mode".
    </p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
      "use strict";
      x = 3.14; // This will cause an error (x is not defined).
    </script>
    <script>
      // Create an object:
      const person = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        id: 5566,
        fullName: function () {
          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        },
      };

      // Display data from the object:
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.fullName();
    </script>
<button id="btn">Click Me!</button>

<p id="demo1"></p>

<script>
let hellothis = "";

hellothis = function() {
  document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML += this;
}

//The window object calls the function:
window.addEventListener("load", hellothis);

//A button object calls the function:
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", hellothis);
</script>
<p>
    JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.

<p id="demo2"></p>
<script>
    class Car {
      constructor(name, year) {
        this.name = name;
        this.year = year;
      }
    }
    
    const myCar1 = new Car("Ford", 2014);
    const myCar2 = new Car("Audi", 2019);
    
    document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML =
    myCar1.name + " " + myCar2.name;
